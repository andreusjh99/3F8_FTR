# 3F8_FTR
University of Cambridge IIA Engineering 3F8 Coursework and FTR: Code and Report

## General Info
Inference module coursework. This coursework aims to implement a Bayesian logistic binary classifier with RBF feature expansion on the inputs. Three approaches are considered: maximum likelihood (ML), maximum a posteriori (MAP) and full Bayesian approach (using Laplace approximation)

## Files
* `X.txt` : Feature input of data
* `y.txt` : Binary label of data
* `misc.py` : Contains all the functions for the project - some provided with the coursework, but all major functions concerning the logistic classifier were self-developed.
* `run.py` : The main script. Contains the implementation of the classifier. Blocks of codes are defined for each approach.
    Default: all blocks are commented. Uncomment the block associated with the approach to implement the approach.
* **Documents** : Contains the coursework description, FTR description and the reports for both the short coursework and the FTR.
